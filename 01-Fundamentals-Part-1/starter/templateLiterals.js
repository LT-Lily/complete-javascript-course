const firstName = "Lily";

const Lily = `I'm ${firstName}, I am a ${job}, born in ${birthYear}, the same year Ruby was born.`;

console.log(Lily);

// NICE TIP!:

console.log(
  `Some developers use backticks for all strings so it's easier to go back and switch out regular quotes`
);

// Usecase:     Multiline string with Template Literals
console.log(`Line 1
line 2
line 3
just
press
enter
after
each 
word`);
