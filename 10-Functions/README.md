Default Parameters

==========================
Values vs References

Passing arguments into functions
Primitives VS Objects (Primitive Types vs Reference Types)
How they work in the context of functions:

In programming there are 2 terms used frequently whe dealing with functions:
// passing by value and passing by reference
// JAVASCRIPT DOES NOT HAVE PASSING BY REFERENCE (original value outside function can change).
// JAVASCRIPT ONLY HAS PASS BY VALUE
// For Objects, we do pass in a reference (the memory address of the object) but that reference is a VALUE. A value that contains a memory address.
// We pass a reference--> function BY VALUE, NOT BY REFERENCE.
==========================

# First-class and Higher-Order Functions

JS has First-class functions.
IMPORTANT FEATURE OF JS LANGUAGE:
JS treats functions as first-clss citizens. This means that functions are simply treated as values.

# Why does JS work this way?

Functions are another type of OBJECT in JS.
Functions are values -> Objects are values too

Since Functions are values, what can we do with them?

- store in variables or object properties.

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const counter = {
value: 23,
inc: function(){this.value++;}
}

- pass functions as arguments to other functions

const greet= () => console.log("Hi Lily");
btnClose.addEventListener("click", greet);

- return function from another function
- functions have objects. objects have methods. Like, array methods. There are also FUNCTION METHODS. We can call a method on a function.
  Eg. .bind method

The fact that JS has first class FUNCTIONS --> we can write HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS:

What is a Higher-Order Function?
A function that:

- 1. receives another function as an argument
     && OR
- 2. returns a new function

# 1. - receives another function as an argument

     const greet= () => console.log("Hi Lily");
     btnClose.addEventListener("click", greet);

# .addEventListener HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION

why? --> recievs another function as an INPUT.
A function that recieves another function as an input is a HIGHER-ORDER function.

# greet CALLBACK FUNCTION

The function passed IN is a callback function. Thta is because the callback function will be CALLED BACK later by the HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION.

The HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION --calls--> CALLBACK FUNCTION

# 2. Function that returns a new function

    function count(){ <------ HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION
        let counter = 0;
        return function(){ <--returned function
            counter;
        };
    }

# What is the difference between FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS and HIGHER-ORDER-FUNCTIONS?

CONCEPT: First-class Functions
Just a feature that a programming language has or doesn't have. It means FUNCTIONS == VALUES. - There are no first-class functions in practice. It is just a CONCEPT.
Higher-order-functions
In practice: YES. Possible because a language supports FIRST-CLASS-FUNCTIONS.
======================================================
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

Definition:
A JS function that runs as soon as it is defined.

SYNTAX:
(
function(){}
)();

If we assign an IIFE to a variable, the value of the variable stores the return value of the IIFE, not the function itself

- The value within an IIFE is encapsulated.

var result = (function(){
var name = "Lily";
return name;
})();

# 130. Function Accepts Callback Functions

# Callback functions

# IMPORTANT !!!!!!

const transformer = function (str, funct) {
console.log(`Original string: ${str}`);
console.log(`Transformed string: ${funct(str)}`); // LATER IS HERE
// functions can have methods and properties.
console.log(`Transformed by: ${funct.name} ==========`); // => returns the name of the generic function. -upperFirstWord
};

transformer('Javascript is great!', upperFirstWord);
transformer('Javascript is great!', oneWord);

# EG

# lower level of abstraction

const high5 = function () {
console.log(`ðŸ‘‹`);
};

# higher level of abstraction

document.body.addEventListener('click', high5);
